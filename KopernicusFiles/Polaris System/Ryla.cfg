            description = A large gas giant that is primarily composed of hydrogen with a substantial amount of helium. It is believed to have a rocky core roughly 2000 km in diameter but otherwise has no defined surface. Surrounding the planet is a thick planetary ring system that orbits around the equator, likely as a result of two large moons colliding with each other.
