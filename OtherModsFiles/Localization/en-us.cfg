        #LOC_KGR_Planets_Cite_description = Cite is a young rocky moon with a diameter around the size of Eve. It is a world very full of craters with many impact sites of more than 100 km in diameter. Sites with less impact were probably much more numerous in the past, but have since eroded. The water covers approximately a quarter of the surface, most of which is in craters, which keeps most of Cite's house near them.
